title: The Monster Math
---

A creature in Pathfinder has many statistics, and if you want to create your own, you can peruse the
rules for [Building Creatures](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995). Let your head fill with tables
upon tables with seemingly arbitrary nunbers. But is there a method to this madness? And how do player
characters stack up to the monsters?

# Creature Statistics

Most of the tables follow relatively straightforward rules that you can figure out by staring at them
for too long. Luckily for you, I have stared at them for too long, so we can skip right to the
good bit. For each statistic, I will stick to the numbers from level 1 and above.
Let us start with Armor Class.

## Armor Class

The rules for Armor Class are very simple:
- Armor Class starts at DC 15, and increases with the level of the creature.
- Every even level, Armor Class increases by an additional +1.
- If a creature has Low AC, decrease it by 2. If it has High AC, increase it by 1. If it has Extreme AC, increase it by 4.
That's it, those are all the rules.

The rules also note that high AC is comparable to a PC fighter,
while Extreme would be comparable to a champion or Monk. This does not seem unreasonable at first, as fighters
often wear heavy armor, increasing their AC by 1, similar to High AC. Champions and Monks will however
in general increase their AC by 3, not 4.

### Player Characters
So how does a martial PC stack up to this? By these rules, a creature's AC will increase by 10 more than you'd expect from
a purely level-based perspective. A player's AC will however only increase by 7 over the same 20 levels.
Going from Trained to Expert to Master increases the AC by 4, while magical armor increases by another 3.
However, we also note that a level 1 martial PC will typically start with an AC of 18, where a creature starts
with an AC of 15, a 3 point difference. This will bridge the remaining 3 point gap, so we see that a PC
will, in the end, have roughly Moderate AC, or High if you wear Heavy Armor.

The only remaining point of interest would be _when_ these armor increases happen for PCs compared to creatures.
As mentioned, creatures get the +1 regularly every even level, while PCs are a bit more haphazard.
- Creatures will use up to level 8 to catch up to the high starting AC martials have, with martials only getting a single increase (+1 magic armor), and creatures getting four increases.
- Expert Proficiency at level 13 negates the level 12 and 14 creature bonuses, while Master proficiency at level 19 negates the level 18 and 20 creature bonuses.
- The remaining bonuses to negate are then level 10 and level 16 bonuses.
  - The level 10 bonus is negated at PC level 11 with their new shiny +2 magic armor.
  - The level 16 bonus is negated at PC level 18 when they get their +3 magic armor.
A couple of observations one could have from this:
- Why is the +2 magic armor not a level 10 item?
- Why is the +3 magic armor not a level 16 item?
The levels 16 to 18 is the longest stretch where Creature AC is in the lead, due to the late addition of the +3 magic armor.
