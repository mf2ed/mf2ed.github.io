title: The Monster Math
---

A creature in Pathfinder has many statistics, and if you want to create your own, you can peruse the
rules for [Building Creatures](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995). Let your head fill with tables
upon tables with seemingly arbitrary nunbers. But is there a method to this madness? And how do player
characters stack up to the monsters?

In this essay, I will look at how the statistics of creatures change as they increase in level, and how
this compares to the increases player characters recieve as they level up.

# Creature Statistics

Most of the tables follow relatively straightforward rules that you can figure out by staring at them
for slightly too long. Luckily for you, I have already stared at them for slightly too long, so we can skip right to the
good bit. For each statistic, I will stick to the numbers from level 1 and above, as most of the rules break slightly at sub-zero levels.

## Table of Contents
1. [Armor Class](#armor-class)
2. [Strike Attack Bonus](#strike-attack-bonus)
3. [Saving Throws](#saving-throws)
4. [Perception](#perception)
5. [Spells](#spells)
6. [Hit Points](#hit-points)
7. [Damage](#damage)

## Armor Class

The rules for Armor Class are very simple:
- Armor Class starts at DC 15, and increases with the level of the creature.
- Every even level, Armor Class increases by an additional +1.
- If a creature has Low AC, decrease it by 2. If it has High AC, increase it by 1. If it has Extreme AC, increase it by 4.

That's it, those are all the rules.

The rules also note that high AC is comparable to a fighter,
while Extreme would be comparable to a champion or monk. This does not seem unreasonable at first, as fighters
often wear heavy armor, increasing their AC by 1, similar to High AC. Champions and Monks will however
in general increase their AC by 3, not 4. 

### Player Characters
So how does a martial PC stack up to this? By these rules, a creature's AC will increase by 10 more than what you get by just leveling up.

A martial's AC will however only increase by 7 over the same 20 levels.
Going from Trained to Expert to Master increases the AC by 4, while magical armor increases by another 3.
However, we also note that a level 1 martial PC will typically start with an AC of 18, where a creature starts
with an AC of 15, a 3 point difference. This will bridge the remaining 3 point gap. In the end, a martial PC have roughly Moderate AC, or High if you wear Heavy Armor.

The only remaining point of interest would be _when_ these armor increases happen for PCs compared to creatures.
As mentioned, creatures get the +1 regularly every even level, while PCs are a bit more haphazard.
- Creatures will use up to level 8 to catch up to the high starting AC martials have, with martials only getting a single increase (+1 magic armor), and creatures getting four increases.
- Expert Proficiency at level 13 negates the level 12 and 14 creature bonuses, while Master proficiency at level 19 negates the level 18 and 20 creature bonuses.
- The remaining bonuses to negate are then the level 10 and the level 16 bonuses.
  - The level 10 bonus is negated at PC level 11 with their new shiny +2 magic armor.
  - The level 16 bonus is negated at PC level 18 when they get their +3 magic armor.

A couple of observations:
- Why is the +2 magic armor not a level 10 item?
- Why is the +3 magic armor not a level 16 item?

The levels 16 to 18 is the longest stretch where Creature AC is in the lead, due to the late addition of the +3 magic armor.

## Strike Attack Bonus
The rules for a creature's attack bonus are also very simple:
- Strike Attack Bonus starts at +7, and increases with the level of the creature.
- Every even level, the Attack Bonus increases by an additional +1.
- If a creature has a High Attack Bonus, increase it by 2. If a creature has Extreme Attack Bonus, increase it by 4.
  - Except at level 11, where it is increased by 5, for some reason.

Thesse seem very similar to the rules for AC, except a High Attack Bonus increases it by 2 instead of 1, and I seem to have forgotten to mention a Low attack bonus. This is because a Low Attack Bonus follows its own, slightly different, rules. If you have a Low Attack bonus, the rules are instead as follows:
- Low Strike Attack Bonus starts at +5, and increases with the level of the creature.
- Everly third level, starting at level 2, it increases by an additional +1.

We will later see that this Low Attack progression corresponds to the progression of spell attacks.

### Player Characters
Again, how does a martial PC keep up with this? Again a creature without a low attack bonus will increase theirs by +10 throughout the 20 levels of play. But this time we note that PCs _also_ increase their attack bonus by an additional +10.
- Players get +3 due to magic items.
- Players get +4 due to weapon proficiency increase.
- Players get +3 due to ability increases, including an Apex item.

The increases for players are spread out as follows:
- The magic item bonus at level 2 counteracts the creature's bonus at level 2.
- Expert at level 5 counteracts the creature's bonuses at level 4 and 6.
- The magic item bonus _and_ the ability score increase at level 10 counteracts the creature's bonuses at level 8 and 10.
- Master at level 13 counteracts the creature's bonuses at level 12 and 14.
- The magic item bonus at level 16 counteracts the creature's level 16 bonus.
- An Apex Item at level 17 counteracts the level 18 creature bonus.
- And lastly, an ability score increase at level 20 counteracts the creature's level 20 bonus.

We note that most of these bonuses come at more or less the right level to keep up with the monsters. My only question about the math here is: Why is a +2 magic item not a level 8 item instead of a level 10 item? Both the +1 magic weapon and the +3 magic weapon show up _at_ the level they need to keep the player up to date with the monster attack bonus. But the +2 magic item shows up two levels too late. I don't know why.

## Saving Throws
For Low, Moderate, and High saving throw, the rules are as follows
- Moderate saving throw starts at +7, and increases with the level of the creature.
- Creatures get an additional +1 to their saving throw at levels 4, 6, 9, 11, 14, 16, and 19.
  - This is a +2 per five levels, at the levels _around_ multiples of five.
- If a creature has a High saving throw, increase it by three. If it has a low saving throw, decrease it by three.
  - Except level 16, where High is only increased by two, for some reason.

If a creatures has a Terrible saving throw, the rules are instead as follows
- Terrible saving throw starts at +2, and increases with the level of the creature.
- Creatures get an additional +1 to their saving throw every three levels, starting at level 4.

And if a creature has an Extreme saving throw, the rules are as follows
- Extreme saving throw starts at +10, and increases with the level of the creature.
- Creatures get an additional +1 to their saving throw every odd level.

While we will look at how a PCs saving throw stack up to this, a more interesting question will be how this compares to the spell DC of PC casters.

### Player characters
Figuring out how a Player Character's saving throw compares to a creature's saving throw is less straightforward than both armor class and strike bonus, as there is more variation in classes and also in
whether the relevant ability scores will be boosted. But we have the following facts to work with.
- Martial classes start with two Expert saving throws and one Trained.
- Spellcasters start with expert Will and the other two as trained.
 - Monks are special and start with all three Expert, and Warpriest Cleric count as Martial here.
- Most classes will increase the proficiency of each saving throw _once_.
  - Monks, Barbarians, Bards, Rangers, Rogues and Swashbucklers are special and increase one to Legendary.
- An ability score will increase by roughly +3 if a player decides to focus on it.

This means than an average player character will increase a saving throw by +8 more than just the increase due to level, over 20 levels, if they focus on the relevant skill with their Ability boosts.
This is roughly the same increase a creature will get over 20 levels if they have a Low/Moderate/High saving throw, as creatures get a +7 bonus to their saving throw. Hence a player character will stay in
roughly the same category as they started in.

By looking at the numbers we can see that:
- Terrible saving throw is roughly equivalent to starting as Trained and not bothering to boost the relevant ability score.
- Low saving throw is roughly equivalent to starting as Trained and boosting the ability score when you can.
- Moderate saving throw is roughly equivalent to starting as Expert and boosting the ability score when you can.
- High saving throw is roughly equivalent to starting as Expert and the relevant ability score is your key ability score.
- Expert saving throw you only get as a dexterity-focused Ranger, Rogue, Swashbuckler or possibly Monk. And even then you fall slightly short.

Fortitude for Barbarians and Will for Bards will typically start at Moderate but end at High, as the save will increase to Legendary but the ability will not be your key ability.

Exactly how well these numbers line up to monsters are a bit more class-specific. The magic item bonuses at level 8, 14, and 20 will roughly keep up with the creature increases at level 9, 14, and 19. Ability score increases will roughly keep up with the creature increases at level 4, 11, and 16. This leaves only the level 6 creature increase. 
Some classes will pre-empt this by increasing a save at level 3, while others will wait until level 7 or 9 or even later to finally catch up. The worst offender here is Warpriest Cleric finally becoming Master in Fortitude at level 15. Other than the warpriest, it's Oracle finally becoming Expert in Reflex saves at level 13. There is also some nuance here that depend on whether you start with 12, 14, or 16 in a non-key ability score.

One last thing to note here is that wearing Bulwark armor gives the same +3 to Reflex saves as you would typically otherwise get by increasing your Dexterity with your Ability boosts.

## Perception
A very short section here, as Perception works exactly like a saving throw bonus. Extreme Perception gives the exact same numbers as Extreme Save, High Perception gives the exact same numbers as a High save, and so on. The same rules also apply for players, where classes start either Trained or Expert, and will mostly increase it once. A few classes (Investigator, Ranger, Rogue) increases their perception twice, similar to how a few classes increases one of their saves twice.

## Spells
For Moderate and High spell attack rolls, the rules are as follows:
- A moderate spell attack roll starts at +6, and increases with the level of the creature.
- Creatures get an additional +1 to their spell attack roll every three levels, starting at level 3.
- If a creature has a High spell attack roll, increase it by three.

For Extreme spell attack rolls, the rules are as follows:
- Extreme spell attack roll starts  at +12, and increases with the level of the creature.
- Creatures get an additional +1 to their spell attack roll at levels 2, 4, 7, 9, 12, 14, 17, and 19.
  - This is a +2 per five levels.

For Spell DC, the rule is that you add _eight_ to the spell attack roll. Note that this is different from the rule for players, of adding _ten_. This exarcerbates the problem of spell attacks _already_ winning ties and dice on average rolling more than ten. Creature spellcasters therefore have an effective +4 to their spell attacks compared to their spell DCs.

Comparing spell DCs to saving throws, we note:
- Extreme spell DCs increase at the same pace as Low, Medium, and High saves (but getting bonuses at slightly different levels).
- Moderate and High spell DCs increase at the same rate as _terrible_ saving throws.
  - This doesn't really matter until we hit around level 16, as it is only a difference between +1.33 and +1.4 per level.

### Player Characters
As for previous stats, I want to compare how these increases compare to a player character. We have up until this point noted that for strike bonus and AC, a Moderate stat for a Creature more or less maps over to what a Player Character can expect to have, with PC stats being within ±1 of the Creature stats. This is _not_ the case for spellcasters!

The Building Creatures rules note that a primary spellcaster should have a High spellcasting stat, and we indeed note that a Player Character starts with a High Spell DC of 17. For Creatures, this will then get an extra increase at levels 3 and 6, while player characters need to wait until level 7 before they again catch up to a High Spell DC. So for three levels (3, 4, and 5), the PC spellcaster is at a -1 DC compared to a High Spell DC Creature, and for one level (level 6), the PC spellcaster is at a -2 DC compared to a High Spell DC Creature. It is tempting to compare this to martials, who will at worst lag 1 point behind for 2 levels.

The Creature Spell DC increase at level 9 will be counteracted by the attribute increase at level 10, and the Creature Spell DC increases at level 12 and 15 will be counteracted by hitting Master Spellcasting at level 15. But again the spellcaster is always either lagging behind or barely catching up. It is again tempting to compare to martials, who ended up _ahead_ of Creatures at certain levels.

After level 15, it seems like it's finally the PC spellcaster's time to shine, as their Apex item at level 17 gives them a temporary leg up on the Creature increase at level 18, and after that Legendary spellcasting gives the PC spellcaster a +2 that the Creature spellcaster will never see! Finally, we are in the lead!

At least, so we would think. But the Building Creatures rules recommend giving Creature Spellcasters Extreme spellcasting from level 15 onwards. And compared to that, our PC spellcaster is at a -4 disadvantage at levels 15, 16, and 17, and 18, a -3 disadvantage at level 19, and at a -2 disadvantage at level 20. So we will _almost_ but not quite catch up to an Extreme Spell DC.

And this is of course just Spell DC. For Spell Attack, it's an even bigger gap. As mentioned previously, Creature spellcasters have an effective +2 on their Spell Attacks compared to their Spell DC. So a PC Caster will therefore instead hover around Moderate Spell Attack for most of their career, increasing to High Spell Attack at level 19.

"But", I hear you say, "isn't it more relevant to compare a Player Character's spell DC to a Creature's save?" And you might very well be right, but the story doesn't really change. A player character's Spell DC increase at level 7 is a late counter to a Creature's save increase at levels 4 and 6, the Attribute boost at level 10 takes care of the Creature's save increase at level 9 a bit late, and then the Master Spellcasting at level 15 counters the Creature's save increases at levels 11 and 14. Then the Apex item counters the level 16 increase, and at level 19 our spellcaster both catches up to and surpasses the level 19 creature increase by getting Legendary in spellcasting. Our spellcaster ended up at a +1 advantage compared to the Creature, but were at a -1 or -2 disadvantage for almost half of their career.

It is of course worth noting that all I am doing here is looking at the spell DC and save numbers. I am not looking at how getting access to better spells might more than make up for it at the levels where our spell DC not keeping up with our enemies' saves.
