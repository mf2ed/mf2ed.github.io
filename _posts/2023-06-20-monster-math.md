title: The Monster Math
---

A creature in Pathfinder has many statistics, and if you want to create your own, you can peruse the
rules for [Building Creatures](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995). Let your head fill with tables
upon tables with seemingly arbitrary nunbers. But is there a method to this madness? And how do player
characters stack up to the monsters?

In this essay, I will look at how the statistics of creatures change as they increase in level, and how
this compares to the increases player characters recieve as they level up.

# Creature Statistics

Most of the tables follow relatively straightforward rules that you can figure out by staring at them
for slightly too long. Luckily for you, I have already stared at them for slightly too long, so we can skip right to the
good bit. For each statistic, I will stick to the numbers from level 1 and above, as most of the rules break slightly at sub-zero levels.

## Armor Class

The rules for Armor Class are very simple:
- Armor Class starts at DC 15, and increases with the level of the creature.
- Every even level, Armor Class increases by an additional +1.
- If a creature has Low AC, decrease it by 2. If it has High AC, increase it by 1. If it has Extreme AC, increase it by 4.

That's it, those are all the rules.

The rules also note that high AC is comparable to a PC fighter,
while Extreme would be comparable to a champion or Monk. This does not seem unreasonable at first, as fighters
often wear heavy armor, increasing their AC by 1, similar to High AC. Champions and Monks will however
in general increase their AC by 3, not 4.

### Player Characters
So how does a martial PC stack up to this? By these rules, a creature's AC will increase by 10 more than you'd expect from
a purely level-based perspective. 

A player's AC will however only increase by 7 over the same 20 levels.
Going from Trained to Expert to Master increases the AC by 4, while magical armor increases by another 3.
However, we also note that a level 1 martial PC will typically start with an AC of 18, where a creature starts
with an AC of 15, a 3 point difference. This will bridge the remaining 3 point gap. In the end, a martial PC have roughly Moderate AC, or High if you wear Heavy Armor.

The only remaining point of interest would be _when_ these armor increases happen for PCs compared to creatures.
As mentioned, creatures get the +1 regularly every even level, while PCs are a bit more haphazard.
- Creatures will use up to level 8 to catch up to the high starting AC martials have, with martials only getting a single increase (+1 magic armor), and creatures getting four increases.
- Expert Proficiency at level 13 negates the level 12 and 14 creature bonuses, while Master proficiency at level 19 negates the level 18 and 20 creature bonuses.
- The remaining bonuses to negate are then the level 10 and the level 16 bonuses.
  - The level 10 bonus is negated at PC level 11 with their new shiny +2 magic armor.
  - The level 16 bonus is negated at PC level 18 when they get their +3 magic armor.

A couple of observations:
- Why is the +2 magic armor not a level 10 item?
- Why is the +3 magic armor not a level 16 item?

The levels 16 to 18 is the longest stretch where Creature AC is in the lead, due to the late addition of the +3 magic armor.

## Strike Attack Bonus
The rules for a creature's attack bonus are also very simple:
- Strike Attack Bonus starts at +7, and increases with the level of the creature.
- Every even level, the Attack Bonus increases by an additional +1.
- If a creature has a High Attack Bonus, increase it by 2. If a creature has Extreme Attack Bonus, increase it by 4.
  - Except at level 11, where it is increased by 5, for some reason.

Thesse seem very similar to the rules for AC, except a High Attack Bonus increases it by 2 instead of 1, and I seem to have forgotten to mention a Low attack bonus. This is because a Low Attack Bonus follows its own, slightly different, rules. If you have a Low Attack bonus, the rules are instead as follows:
- Low Strike Attack Bonus starts at +5, and increases with the level of the creature.
- Everly third level, starting at level 2, it increases by an additional +1.

We will later see that this Low Attack progression corresponds to the progression of spell attacks.

### Player Characters
Again, how does a martial PC keep up with this? Again a creature without a low attack bonus will increase theirs by +10 throughout the 20 levels of play. But this time we note that PCs _also_ increase their attack bonus by an additional +10.
- Players get +3 due to magic items.
- Players get +4 due to weapon proficiency increase.
- Players get +3 due to ability increases, including an Apex item.

The increases for players are spread out as follows:
- The magic item bonus at level 2 counteracts the creature's bonus at level 2.
- Expert at level 5 counteracts the creature's bonuses at level 4 and 6.
- The magic item bonus _and_ the ability score increase at level 10 counteracts the creature's bonuses at level 8 and 10.
- Master at level 13 counteracts the creature's bonuses at level 12 and 14.
- The magic item bonus at level 16 counteracts the creature's level 16 bonus.
- An Apex Item at level 17 counteracts the level 18 creature bonus.
- And lastly, an ability score increase at level 20 counteracts the creature's level 20 bonus.

We note that most of these bonuses come at more or less the right level to keep up with the monsters. My only question about the math here is: Why is a +2 magic item not a level 8 item instead of a level 10 item? Both the +1 magic weapon and the +3 magic weapon show up _at_ the level they need to keep the player up to date with the monster attack bonus. But the +2 magic item shows up two levels too late. I don't know why.

## Saving Throws
For Low, Moderate, and High saving throw, the rules are as follows
- Moderate saving throw starts at +7, and increases with the level of the creature.
- Creatures get an additional +1 to their saving throw at levels 4, 6, 9, 11, 14, 16, and 19.
  - This is a +2 per five levels, at the levels _around_ multiples of five.
- If a creature has a High saving throw, increase it by three. If it has a low saving throw, decrease it by three.
  - Except level 16, where High is only increased by two, for some reason.

If a creatures has a Terrible saving throw, the rules are instead as follows
- Terrible saving throw starts at +2, and increases with the level of the creature.
- Creatures get an additional +1 to their saving throw every three levels, starting at level 4.

And if a creature has an Extreme saving throw, the rules are as follows
- Extreme saving throw starts at +10, and increases with the level of the creature.
- Creatures get an additional +1 to their saving throw every odd level.

While we will look at how a PCs saving throw stack up to this, a more interesting question will be how this compares to the spell DC of PC casters.

### Player characters
Figuring out how a Player Character's saving throw compares to a creature's saving throw is less straightforward than both armor class and strike bonus, as there is more variation in classes and also in
whether the relevant ability scores will be boosted. But we have the following facts to work with.
- Martial classes start with two Expert saving throws and one Trained.
- Spellcasters start with expert Will and the other two as trained.
 - Monks are special and start with all three Expert, and Warpriest Cleric count as Martial here.
- Most classes will increase the proficiency of each saving throw _once_.
  - Monks, Barbarians, Bards, Rangers, Rogues and Swashbucklers are special and increase one to Legendary.
- An ability score will increase by roughly +3 if a player decides to focus on it.

This means than an average player character will increase a saving throw by +8 more than just the increase due to level, over 20 levels, if they focus on the relevant skill with their Ability boosts.
This is roughly the same increase a creature will get over 20 levels if they have a Low/Moderate/High saving throw, as creatures get a +7 bonus to their saving throw. Hence a player character will stay in
roughly the same category as they started in.

By looking at the numbers we can see that:
- Terrible saving throw is roughly equivalent to starting as Trained and not bothering to boost the relevant ability score more than maybe once.
- Low saving throw is roughly equivalent to starting as Trained
- Moderate saving throw is roughly equivalent to starting as Expert
- High saving throw is roughly equivalent to starting as Expert and the relevant ability score is your key ability score.
- Expert saving throw you only get as a dexterity-focused Ranger, Rogue, Swashbuckler or possibly Monk. And even then you fall slightly short.

Exactly how well these numbers line up to monsters are a bit more class-specific. The magic item bonuses at level 8, 14, and 20 will roughly keep up with the creature increases at level 9, 14, and 19. Ability score increases will roughly keep up with the creature increases at level 4, 11, and 16. This leaves only the level 6 creature increase. 
And some classes will pre-empt this by increasing a save at level 3, while others will wait until level 7 or 9 or even later to finally catch up. The worst offender here is Warpriest Cleric finally becoming Master in Fortitude at level 15. Other than the warpriest, it's Oracle finally becoming Expert in Reflex saves at level 13. There is also some nuance here that depend on whether you start with 12, 14, or 16 in a non-key ability score.

One last thing to note here is that wearing Bulwark armor gives the same +3 to Reflex saves as you would get by actually increasing your Dexterity with your Ability boosts.
